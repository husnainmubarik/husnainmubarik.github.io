I'm a PhD candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) 
department at the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), 
advised by Prof. [Rakesh Kumar](https://passat.crhc.illinois.edu/). 
My research interests are generally in the areas of Hardware Systems and Computer 
Architecture. Particularly, I'm interested in Machine Learning Accelerators, 
HW Acceleration of Cloud Gaming, 
Heterogeneous Parallel Systems, Earable Computing, 
Distributed Computing, Digital IC Design, Printed Computer Systems 
and Emerging Technologies/Applications.
