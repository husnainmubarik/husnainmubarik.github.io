I'm a PhD candidate in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) 
department at the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), 
advised by Prof. [Rakesh Kumar](https://passat.crhc.illinois.edu/). 
My research interests are generally in the areas of Hardware Systems and Computer 
Architecture. Particularly, I'm interested in 
Hardware Acceleration of Neural Graphics, 
Low Power and Energy Efficient Graphics, 
Machine Learning Accelerators, 
Heterogeneous Parallel Systems, 
Flexible Computer Systems 
and Emerging Technologies/Applications.
