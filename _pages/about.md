I'm a PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) department at the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), advised by Prof. [Rakesh Kumar](https://passat.crhc.illinois.edu/) 
My research interests are generaally in the areas of Hardware Systems and Computer Architecture. Particularly I'm interested in Machine Learning Accelerators, Heterogeneous Parallel Systems, Distributed Computing, Printed Computer Systems and Emerging Technologies/Applications.
